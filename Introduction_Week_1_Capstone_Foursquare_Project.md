### Coursera Capstone Project for IBM Data Science Specialization - Week 1
By Nicholas Tsangari

# 1. Introduction

# 1.1. Background

London has the largest number of migrants among all regions of the UK, 3,317,000 – or 35% of the UK’s total foreign-born population. In 2019, people born outside the UK made up an estimated 14% of the UK’s population, or 9.5 million people. That makes London one of the most diverse cities in the world.

Compared to the UK born, migrants are more likely to be aged 26 to 64, and less likely to be children or people of retirement age. Typically, between the lower end of 26-64 is when people take risks and open up their own businesses. Being a diverse, cosmopolitan city, London is home to a number of restaurants serving a variety of cuisines, hailing it as the most diverse and exciting food capital of the world.

Out of those numbers of migrants listed above, is portion of the Greek Cypriot community whom many began emigrating to the UK in the late 50's in search of a better life. With that, some had the desire and ambition to open up their own restaurants and replicate dishes once served in their motherland. They didn't have the use of APIs like FourSquare to know where to set up shop. And that is where our story begins...

# 1.2. Problem Description

If someone visits London for the first time, and has a strong desire for Greek cuisine then it would be handy for them to have some information on where the nearest/higest rated Greek Cypriot restaurant would be, right? Or what about those that would like to open a Greek restaurant but are worried about competitors?

That, in short, is our problem to solve. We want to help tourists on holiday or immigrants who are starting a brand new life in the UK to find out where the best Greek restaurants are and the likelihood of opening one.

I will be using UK based restaurant data and FourSquare API as part of this project.

By utilizing the London restaurants data and FourSquare API I will be looking to assess the
risk category of restaurants and provide ratings/nearest restaurants data to the user at hand.

# 1.3. Target Audience
-  Ambitious entrepreneurs looking to open a Greek restaurant.
-  Tourists who would like to visit a Greek restaurant.
